# **Network Layer**

Summary: Decides which physical path the data will take

The network layer does two main things. Breaking and reassembling packets on the sending and receiving devices and routing packets by finding the best path across a physical network. The network layer uses network addresses, which are typically IP addresses to route packets to their destination.
