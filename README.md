Author: Steven Wu

Summary: This article will talk about the idea and characteristcs of the 7 layers in the OSI Model

Target Audience: Anyone who wants to learn about the OSI Model

What is the OSI Model?:
It is a open systems interconnection model that was created by the International Organization for Standardzation. Having it standardized allows computers to use standard protocols effectively.

The OSI model splits the communication system into seven layers:
  - [Application Layer](./applicationLayer.md)
  - [Presentation Layer](./presentationLayer.md)
  - [Session Layer](./sessionLayer.md)
  - [Transport Layer](./transportLayer.md)
  - [Network Layer](./networkLayer.md)
  - [Data Link Layer](./dataLinkLayer.md)
  - [Physical Layer](./physicalLayer.md)
