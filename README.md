The open systems interconnection model was created by the International Organization for Standardization which allows computers to use standard protocols.
The OSI model splits the communication system into seven layers:
  - [Application Layer](./applicationLayer.md)
  - [Presentation Layer](./presentationLayer.md)
  - [Session Layer](./sessionLayer.md)
  - [Transport Layer](./transportLayer.md)
  - [Network Layer](./networkLayer.md)
  - [Data Link Layer](./dataLinkLayer.md)
  - [Physical Layer](./physicalLayer.md)
Individual layers handles it's own specific job and talks with the layers around it.
