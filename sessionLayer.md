# **Session Layer**

Summary: Maintains connection and responsible for controlling ports and sessions

The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices. It is responsible for opening sessions, ensuring they remain open and functional while data is being transferred, and closing them when communication ends. The session layer can also set checkpoints during a data transferâ€”if the session is interrupted, devices can resume data transfer from the last checkpoint.
