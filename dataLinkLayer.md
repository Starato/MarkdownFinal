# **Data Link Layer**

Summary: Defines the format of data on the network

The data link layer helps with establishing and terminating connections between physically connected nodes on a network. The data link layer breaks up packets into frames then sends them from their source to their destination. Two parts make up this layer; Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). LLC identifies network protoccols and performs error checking and synchronizes the frames. MAC uses MAC addresses to connect devices and defines permissions to send and receive data.
