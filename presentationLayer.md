# **Presentation Layer**

Summary: Ensures that data is in a usable format and this is when encryption happens

The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compress data so it is received correctly on the other end. The presentation layer takes any data transmitted by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.
