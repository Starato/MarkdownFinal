# **Presentation Layer**

Summary: Ensures that data is in a usable format and this is when encryption happens

The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. The presentation layer defines how devices should encode, encrypt, and compress so it is received correctly between the two devices. This layer also takes any kind of data and trasmit it by the application layer and prepares it for transmission over the session layer.
